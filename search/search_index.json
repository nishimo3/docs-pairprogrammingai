Background Today, the number of products (home appliances, smart phones, cars, etc.) with built-in computers continues to increase. The software that controls the computers is critical to running these products. Software is becoming increasingly complex and large-scale, and it is said that there is a shortage of software developers. In such a situation, software developers in the field are facing various difficulties. The following is an example. I have taken over a project from my predecessor, but the specifications and design documents are insufficient and I cannot understand the source code. There are no specifications or other documentation, only source code. The number of skilled developers is limited, and the number of days until delivery is limited. Our Goal Our goal is to make it possible to develop software efficiently in a short time with less burden on developers.We also want to create an environment where developers can concentrate on their creative work. To achieve this goal, we are focusing on a development method called \"pair programming\". Pair programming is a method in which two developers work together to develop a single piece of software. The software developed by this method tends to be of high quality, but the development cost increases. Therefore, we aim to realize the \"Pair Programming AI\" that extracts and provides the know-how of professional developers from specifications, source code and so on. Concept The \"pair programming AI\" can assist in the design, implementation, and verification of software, just as if an experienced software developer were standing next to you to help you. The following is a list of skills of the pair programming AI. Code Reading: understand what the program is writing. Coding: assists coding by having knowledge about programming. Developer behavior and thinking: Understand the developer's development style and be able to identify and advise on points that are often overlooked. We think that pair programming AI has the advantage of being less costly and more readily available than pair programming. Approach to realize Pair Programing AI Concept As shown in the figure below, the basic approach of Pair Programming AI is to extract knowledge from software specifications, design documents, and source code, process and organize them, and provide them to developers in an easy-to-use method.","title":"Pair Programming AI Concept"},{"location":"concept/#pair-programming-ai-concept","text":"We introduce the Pair Programming AI concept.","title":"Pair Programming AI Concept"},{"location":"concept/#background","text":"Today, the number of products (home appliances, smart phones, cars, etc.) with built-in computers continues to increase.

Overview \"CSExtractor (CodeSnippet Extractor)\" is a tool that extracts a set of statements from the source code, focusing on the dependencies of variables. The tool considers that the set of statements represents a functionality. We believe that the set of statements will help you understand the source code. This page introduces the CSExtractor for source code written in the Swift language. 2. Approach We think that it would be helpful to understand the code if we could grasp the following statements as a set. A statement in which the focus variable of the target statement is being processed A definition statement for the focus variable A definition and reference statements for other variables referenced in the above statements Note that the focus variable is defined as follows: Assignment statement: the variable that appears on the left side (e.g., xxx.aaa = yyy -> xxx) Call function statement: variable to which the function is applied (e.g., xxx.func(...) -> xxx) Example The target statement \"label.text = \"\\(self.count)\"\" , is an operation on the variables of label . If you can grasp the other statements of the operation on label (e.g., \"label.text = \"(self.count)\"\" in pushBtn function) and the definition statement of label (e.g., \"@IBOutlet weak var label: UILabel!\" ), you may be able to understand the whole process on label . It may also be helpful to understand the definitions and references of other variables referred to in these statements (e.g., \"fileprivate var count = 0\" ). 3. Architecture CSExtractor creates AST(Abstract Syntax Tree) by parsing statements and source code. It analyzes the dependencies of variables on the AST and generates a CS Graph. Then, it extracts a set of statements based on the CS Graph. Parsing the program Generating a graph of code snippet (CS graph) and extracting a set of statement How to parse the program The tool parses the source code and creates an AST. It analyzes the dependencies of the data on the AST and generates the CS Graph. The tool uses swift-syntax for parsing. How to generate CS Graph and extract a set of statements The flow of generating the CS Graph and extracting a set of statements is shown below. CSExtractor constructs a CS Graph based on the pointer, argument, and assignment relationships of variables that appear in the target statement. \"label.text = \"\\(self.count)\"\" is added to the set of statements. The tool adds the definition statement of the label, which is a focus variable, into the CS Graph. \"@IBOutlet weak var label: UILabel!\" is added to the set of statements. The tool adds other statements of the focus variable to the CS graph. \"label.text = \"(self.count)\"\" in pushBtn function is added to the set of statements. The tool adds the definition statement of the count variable referenced in the target statement to the CS Graph. \"fileprivate var count = 0\" is added to the set of statements. 4.
